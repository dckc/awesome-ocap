  - [Newspeak](https://newspeaklanguage.org/) is an object-capability programming platform that lets you develop code in your web browser. Like Self, Newspeak is message-based; all names are dynamically bound. However, like Smalltalk, Newspeak uses classes rather than prototypes.
    The current version of Newspeak runs on top of WASM.

  - [Monte](http://www.monte-language.org/) is a nascent dynamic
    programming language reminiscent of Python and E. It is based upon
    _The Principle of Least Authority_ (POLA), which governs
    interactions between objects, and a _capability-based object
    model_, which grants certain essential safety guarantees to all
    objects.
    - bootstrapped from rpython (pypy toolchain) and libuv and
    libsodium using (primarily) the nix build system.

  - [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/cadence) is a smart contract language with resources (linear types) and capability security.
    Its static type system has direct support for object-capability security. For example, the facade pattern is natively supported, and the type system has special down-casting rules to express access control patterns.

    - 2019-09 [An Introduction to CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-941.pdf)
      > CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions) extends conventional processor Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with architectural capabilities to enable fine-grained memory protection and highly scalable software compartmentalization. CHERI’s hybrid capability-system approach allows architectural capabilities to be integrated cleanly with contemporary RISC architectures and microarchitectures, as well as with MMU-based C/C++- language software stacks.
      > 
      > CHERI’s capabilities are unforgeable tokens of authority, which can be used to implement both explicit pointers (those declared in the language) and implied pointers (those used by the runtime and generated code) in C and C++. When used for C/C++ memory protection, CHERI directly mitigates a broad range of known vulnerability types and exploit techniques. Support for more scalable software compartmentalization facilitates software mitigation techniques such as sandboxing, which also defend against future (currently unknown) vulnerability classes and exploit techniques.
      > 
      > We have developed, evaluated, and demonstrated this approach through hardware-software prototypes, including multiple CPU prototypes, and a full software stack. This stack includes an adapted version of the Clang/LLVM compiler suite with support for capability-based C/C++, and a full UNIX-style OS (CheriBSD, based on FreeBSD) implementing spatial, referential, and (currently for userspace) non-stack temporal memory safety. Formal modeling and verification allow us to make strong claims about the security properties of CHERI-enabled architectures.
      > 
      > This report is a high-level introduction to CHERI. The report describes our architectural approach, CHERI’s key microarchitectural implications, our approach to formal modeling and proof, the CHERI software model, our software-stack prototypes, further reading, and potential areas of future research.

We have developed SCoopFS (Simple Cooperative File Sharing) as a demonstration that need not be so. SCoopFS addresses the problem of sharing files, both with others and with ourselves across machines. Although SCoopFS provides server authentication, client authorization, and end-to-end encryption, the user never sees any of that. The user interface and underlying infrastructure are designed so that normal user acts of designation provide all the information needed to make the desired security decisions. While SCoopFS is a useful tool, it may be more important as a demonstration of the usability that comes from designing the infrastructure and user interaction together._

_The ACL model is unable to make correct access decisions for interactions involving more than two  principals, since required information is not retained across message sends. Though this deficiency has long been documented in the published literature, it is not widely understood. This logic error in the ACL model is exploited by both the clickjacking and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks that affect many Web applications_

 _The broad goal of this research was to assess whether capability-based security [Levy84] could achieve security goals that are unachievable with current traditional security technologies such as access control lists and firewalls. The specific goal of this research was to create an HTML browser that could use capability confinement on a collection of plug-replaceable, possibly malicious, rendering engines. In confining the renderer, the browser would ensure that a malicious renderer could do no harm either to the browser or to the underlying system._

Thanks for your contribution!

## README structure

Sections are ordered in increasing effort / investment, from a few clicks to use a hosted web service
to writing code with libraries and frameworks to switching programming languages to replacing your OS
or even your hardware.

Emphasis is on active projects, preferably with dated items that show recent progress.
The presentations, videos, and articles are somewhat exempt, since
the material to be learned applies reasonably well to all projects.

The format of a typical entry is:

- YYYY-MM: [Title of linked doc](url-of-linked-doc) "exerpt..."

and/or

- YYYY-MM: [Title of linked doc](url-of-linked-doc) summarized news...

## Coding style

For JavaScript, use Airbnb style. Never leave blank space at the end of a line.

All I/O, randomness, clock, etc. should be injected explicitly to each module level function.
Each function / method should get the least authority that it needs.
